# RL_Reversal_depression

The aim of the project is to test whether the anhedonia and depression covariate with computational parameters. In addition, the effects of prediction error on memory encoding will also be tested. 

Description of the files in this repository:

### data_RL_screen
Raw data in which participants who did not reach the threshold on the learning phase were already removed. 

### data_RL_screen_scoring
Preprocessed data. The script "00_check_data.R" performs some preprocessing on the data.

### Figures
Relevant figures

### Fitting functions
Functions used to fit the different modles

### Group data
Datasets including all the participants

### helper_functions
R functions used by the different scripts
